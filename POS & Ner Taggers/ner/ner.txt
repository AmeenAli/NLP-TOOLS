The NER results are lower than the POS results 
(how much lower?), look at the data and think why.

They are 5%-15% lower.
The POS dataset contains a big number of tags, 
therefore, not all the possible sequences are captured 
and the assumption of the next tag based on previous tags 
is limited to the seen tags only. 
On the other hand, the NER dataset contains only a few 
tags, therefore, all the possible sequences are captured
and there are not many of them, so the prediction is less
accurate.

Another way is to consider precision, recall and F-measure 
for correctly identified spans. (what is your spans F-measure?).

In the statistics below

The span-based F scores are lower than the accuracy scores. Why?

The span scores are based on a combination between the precision 
score and the recall score. 
Whereas the accuracy scores are more like the precision score.

Can you improve the MEMM tagger on the NER data?

We can use external knowledge to improve accuracy. For example, 
lists extracted from the web that cover common names, countries, 
monetary units, temporal expressions, etc.
